## Goal
During the lifetime of garrysmod many weapon bases consisting of poor quality were created, and it would be a shame to see the same in S&box. The goal is to offer an easy to use yet very configurable weapon base maintained by the community for the community.

## Features

### Various
* Controller support (with aim assist)
* No programming skills needed to use
* Highly configurable
* Support for custom animations and actions

### Offset Editor ([Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5jRZZDgej8))
The `swb_editor_offsets` command opens a model editor that can be used to easily calculate offsets needed for running, zooming, and more.

### Built-in Animations
* Walking
* Crouching
* Running
* Jumping
* Tucking
* Idle
* Sway
* ADS

### Built-in HUD

* Physical (bullet drop & drag)

### Supports
* Magazine Reloading (default)
* Shell based Reloading
* Sniper 2D scopes
* ~Entity (grenades, arrows, props, ...)~ TODO
* ~Melee~ TODO

### Attachments
* Customization menu (`q`)
* Change weapon stats + stacking
* Easy to add

### Weapon Models
* Properly licensed weapon models are included in the base
* They can be used for any purpose as long as the license is respected (credits.txt)

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute by creating a pull request to their branch. Contributors can help out with the planned updates, outstanding bug/issues, or maybe you just have a cool idea that would improve the base, any help is welcome!

## Planned Updates
* More base-included entities (e.g. bomb)
* More attachments
* Worldmodel clipping shader

## Installing
If you want to test out the base drag and drop simple-weapon-base-master into your addons folder, open the editor and add as a new project.
